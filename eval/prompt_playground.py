"""Quick, manual prompt-engineering tool — NOT part of the formal eval bench (no sampling, no
metrics, no report). Just: load both models once, run them against the 2 saved GZ10 test images
in `test_subjects/`, print the raw answers, so you can edit `OOB_PROMPT`/`EQUIPPED_PROMPT` below
and re-run until the output style is what you want.

Real finding this exists to fix (from a real n=20 collection run): the base model's answers were
getting truncated mid-reasoning before ever stating a class, and the equipped model (fine-tuned
on captions) was mostly ignoring the classification instruction and reverting to its trained
free-form captioning style.

Two independent fixes applied here:
  1. Base model gets more generation room (OOB_MAX_NEW_TOKENS) since 5 tokens was cutting it off
     before it reached an answer at all — that's a budget problem, not a prompt problem.
  2. Both prompts switched to a digit-code format. Forcing a 1-token answer space and ending the
     prompt mid-completion ("Image class code:") gives the model much less room to drift into
     free text than asking it to name a class from a long list. The equipped model, being
     caption-tuned, is the harder case — if it still reverts to captioning under this prompt,
     that's a sign it needs decode-time constraint (logits processor / stop sequence) rather than
     further prompt tweaking, since the fine-tuning objective itself pulls toward verbose output.

Usage:
    uv run python -m eval.prompt_playground
    uv run python -m eval.prompt_playground --backend modal   # needs `modal deploy eval/backend.py` first
