"""Loader for `BuildNg/astrobridge-yse-test-dataset-v2` — a real, held-out SN-typing benchmark.
Confirmed directly against the live HF repo, not assumed: 266 rows, every `object_id` unique, and
**zero overlap** with `object_id`s in the training set (`BuildNg/astrobridge-transients-dataset`)
— genuinely disjoint, not accidentally-reused training data. Same schema as the training set
(`object_id, host_image_id, lc_mjd, lc_flux_njy, lc_flux_error_njy, lc_band, atcat_flux,
atcat_flux_error, atcat_band_id, atcat_use, atcat_length, image_flux, image_bands, image_modality,
display_image, class_label`), same 3-class taxonomy — real confirmed counts on this eval set:
`SN Ia` 180, `SN II` 71, `SN Ibc` 15 (same imbalance pattern as training).

Two tracks, from the same underlying dataset:
  - **lightcurve-only** (`load_lightcurve_table`): reuses `captioner.data.transients_dataset`'s
    private loading helpers unchanged, just pointed at this repo instead — same column names,
    same `atcat_*` convention, same invariant checks (`_assert_accepted_counts`), so nothing
    dataset-shape-specific needed reinventing here.
  - **lightcurve + host image** (`load_host_image_table`): genuinely new — the training loader's
    own module docstring calls the host-image columns "debugging artifacts" and never reads them
    for training, so there was no existing loader to extend. `image_modality` is confirmed
    uniformly `LegacySurveyImage` across all 266 rows, matching what `AionImageEncoder` expects,
    but `image_flux`'s actual band count/order has NOT been separately verified here (same-org
    dataset as the training set, so less likely to have an undocumented-band surprise than
    `astronolan/galaxy10-aion` did, but check `build_raw_inputs_with_image`'s shape assertion
    output on a real run before trusting it blindly).

**Base-model comparison, mirroring the image track's `image_rgb` pattern**: a raw lightcurve array
genuinely isn't something an out-of-the-box vision-language model can consume directly (still
true), but `render_lightcurve_plot` below turns one object's `atcat_*` photometry into an ordinary
flux-vs-time PNG scatter plot, which the base model's native-vision pathway *can* consume, same as
`eval.datasets.image_galaxy10.decode_rgb_image` feeds the image track's base side. This is a real,
independent rendering, not a proxy for what the equipped side sees (which reads the raw
`atcat_flux`/`atcat_flux_error`/`atcat_band_id`/`atcat_use` arrays directly, never a plot).

**Deterministic classification (`SN_REASONING_PROMPT`/`SN_CANDIDATES`)**: earlier digit-code and
free-text prompting both showed real compliance failures — a bare digit collapses to one symbol
regardless of the object (confirmed live: base emitted `"2"` on 28/30 objects, equipped never
emitted `"1"` once), and free text needs fuzzy parsing that can fail outright (confirmed live on
v5: equipped's parse rate collapsed to 53% under the chat template). `SN_REASONING_PROMPT` sidesteps
both by never asking for a label at all — the model reasons freely, then `eval/backend.py`'s
`.classify(...)` scores `SN_CANDIDATES`'s three exact label strings as teacher-forced continuations
and takes the argmax, which is always one of the three by construction: no parsing, no unparseable
output, fully deterministic given the same weights.
