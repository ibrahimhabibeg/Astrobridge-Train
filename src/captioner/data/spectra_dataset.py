"""Loader for `UniverseTBD/AstroBridge-Data`, working around a real schema-union failure in
`datasets.load_dataset(hf_path, split="train")` against this repo — confirmed against a real
run, not a guess:

    datasets.table.CastError: Couldn't cast ... because column names don't match

The repo's `observations/spectra/` folder holds four separate parquet files, one per crossmatch
source (DESI-only, DESI+SDSS, DESI+SDSS-subset, SDSS-only). `datasets`'s automatic multi-file
loading tries to cast every file into one strict Arrow schema inferred up front, and fails,
because the SDSS-crossmatched files carry extra `survey`/`survey_metadata` columns the DESI-only
file doesn't have. The core columns this codebase actually reads (`object_id`,
`ra_spectra`/`dec_spectra`, `spectrum`, `Z`/`ZERR`/`ZWARN`, `mention_summary`/`evidence_quotes`/
`arxiv_id`, etc.) are present in every file — only the SDSS-specific extras differ.

Loading each file separately with pandas and `pd.concat`ing sidesteps the cast entirely:
`pd.concat` fills a column missing from one file with NaN for those rows instead of requiring an
exact schema match across all files, which is exactly the flexibility `datasets` doesn't give us
here.

Separately: these files' `spectrum` column is a nested struct (flux/ivar/lsf_sigma/lambda/mask —
the same shape of thing as the image side's `image_legacy`, which hit a real crash reading via
plain `pd.read_parquet`: pyarrow's pandas-metadata-driven dtype restoration chokes on a nested
struct dtype string `numpy.dtype()` can't parse). Reading via `pyarrow.parquet` directly with
`ignore_metadata=True` avoids that class of failure — see data/image_dataset.py's
`_read_parquet_columns` for the full explanation; used here defensively for the same reason.

A third real issue, also confirmed against a real run: the four files are NOT disjoint by
`object_id` — a target can appear in more than one crossmatch-source file (e.g. `..._subset...`
looks like a literal subset of the non-subset file, and a target with both DESI and SDSS spectra
plausibly appears in more than one of the survey-specific files too). `pd.concat` alone leaves
duplicate `object_id` rows in the result, which breaks every downstream `set_index("object_id")`
lookup — one of them (`DataFrame.to_dict(orient="index")` in 01_generate_captions.py) raises
`ValueError: DataFrame index must be unique for orient='index'` outright; others (e.g. a plain
`Series.to_dict()`) would have silently kept whichever duplicate happened to sort last instead of
erroring, which is worse. `load_spectra_table` now deduplicates by `object_id` before returning —
preferring the row with the smallest `_dist_arcsec` (the crossmatch quality metric already in
the data) when duplicates disagree on it, since that's an objective tie-break rather than an
arbitrary one based on file processing order.

A fourth real issue, confirmed against the live repo, and the reason `_canonical_object_id`
exists: the four files spell the *same* `object_id` three different ways — plain digit strings,
int64, and a stringified Python bytes repr of a space-padded fixed-width FITS char field (the
literal text `b'    462849895556999168'`). Canonicalizing is what lets the deduplication below
actually collapse them; see that function's docstring for the two failures it caused.

Separately: `load_gemini_spectra_captions` reads a *different*, teammate-produced dataset
(`ibrahimhabibeg/spectra_captions_dataset`) — a JSONL file of LLM-generated (Gemini) captions,
each grounded purely in one object's spectrum (no object names/coordinates in the prompt, per
inspecting real rows), analogous to what `caption_blind` is for images: a pre-vetted,
modality-restricted caption source, preferred over decomposing `mention_summary` ourselves.
Confirmed real shape: one JSON object per line, `object_key` (join key) plus
`output.caption`/`output.is_insufficient`/`output.thought_summaries` (verbose chain-of-thought,
discarded — never used as caption text). Rows with `is_insufficient=True` (the model itself
flagged not enough evidence) are dropped. `object_key` joins against `wiki_entity_id` — confirmed
present directly on `UniverseTBD/AstroBridge-Data` rows (alongside `object_id`), so no extra
crossmatch file is needed; `01_generate_captions.py` builds the `wiki_entity_id -> object_id`
map from the `spectra_df` it already loads.
